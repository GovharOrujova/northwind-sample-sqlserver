# 📦 Northwind T-SQL Database Project

This project builds the classic *Northwind* database using *T-SQL* and populates it with sample data.  
It is designed for *SQL Server* and includes tables, foreign keys, indexes, and example records.

---

## 📊 Analysis
This database models a realistic business scenario by linking *products, **customers, **orders, **employees, **suppliers, and **shippers*.  
It can be used to answer analytical questions such as:
- Orders placed by each customer
- Product sales statistics by category
- Employee order performance
- Product lists by supplier
- Delivery statistics by shipper

---

## 🗝 Key Concepts Used
- *DDL* (Data Definition Language) commands: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY
- *DML* (Data Manipulation Language) commands: INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE
- *Indexes*: Improving search performance with CREATE INDEX
- *Constraints*: CHECK, NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY
- *SQL Server-specific types & syntax*: NVARCHAR, DECIMAL, GO

---

## 📤 Outputs
After execution, the project provides:
- A fully functional *SQL Server* Northwind-style database
- *Complete relationships* between tables (foreign keys)
- Ability to run queries on real sample data
- Practice with *JOIN* operations across related tables

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install *SQL Server* and *SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)*.
2. Download the northwind.sql file from this repository.
3. Open SSMS and create a new query window.
4. Load the northwind.sql file in the query window and click *Execute*.
5. Once the database is created, start running your queries.

## 📝 Notes
- This script is optimized for *Microsoft SQL Server*.
- Special characters (like ' and \) have been cleaned for SQL Server compatibility.
- All text columns use NVARCHAR to support Unicode (multi-language data).
- You can expand the project by adding VIEW, STORED PROCEDURE, and TRIGGER examples.
